Rachel's Project 1 (Game) for WDI10 Singapore

The Dungeon invites you to take up the most exciting challenge: a connect-3 game with a twist!
Bring the monster's HP down to 0 before time runs out.
You have 60 seconds to do so.

•Start by clicking on any jewel in the grid.

•Connect at least 3 jewels of the same colour to form an attack chain.
•Adjacent jewels of the same colour will automatically chain together in any direction (horizontally, vertically and diagonally).
•The longer the chain, the more powerful the attack!

The Dungeon was created with HTML5, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
Math.random() used to generate jewel types in JavaScript
