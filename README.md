Rachel Lee's Project 1 (Game) for WDI10 Singapore

The Dungeon invites you to take up the most exciting challenge: a connect-3 game with a twist!
Bring the monster's HP down to 0 before time runs out.
You have 60 seconds to do so.

•Start by clicking once on any jewel in the grid.

•Connect at least 3 jewels of the same colour to form an attack chain.
•Adjacent jewels of the same colour will automatically chain together in any direction (horizontally, vertically and diagonally).
•The longer the chain, the more powerful the attack!

------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dungeon was created with HTML5, CSS and vanilla JavaScript after 2 weeks in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. The creator did not have any knowledge on programming/coding prior to this course.

Math.random() used to generate jewel types in JavaScript. Table object was created in JavaScript.

This project would not have been possible if not for the following:

I would like to thank my WDI instructor, Jens Nielson, and wonderful TAs, Iskandar and Geng Sng, for their immense patience and guidance with this project. They have provided a lot of help with the coding and debugging, as well as imparting their wisdom and advice. This project has not been an easy one to tackle, and I am extremely grateful for their help thus far.

Many thanks to my classmates for being so supportive and helpful wherever possible, be it translating of human logic to gaming algorithm and syntax, highlighting and explaining issues in my code, debugging, and encouragement.
