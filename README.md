Rachel's Project 1 (Game) for WDI10 Singapore

The Dungeon invites you to take up the most exciting challenge: a connect-3 game with a twist!
Bring the monster's HP down to 0 before time runs out.
You have 60 seconds to do so.


Click on a jewel to connect a chain of at least 3 of the same kind in adjacent grids (horizontally, vertically, diagonally).
Red, green and blue jewel chains will connect automatically to deduct HP from the monster.
Hourglass chains will connect automatically to add time to the countdown timer.

The longer the chain, the greater the damage dealt to the monster, or the more time added to the countdown timer.

This project would not have been possible if not for the following:

Many thanks to my WDI instructor, Jens Nielson, and wonderful TAs, Iskandar and Geng, for their immense patience and guidance with this project. They have provided a lot of help with the coding and debugging, as well as imparting their wisdom and advice. This project has not been an easy one to tackle, and I am grateful for their help thus far.

Many thanks to my classmates for being so supportive and helpful wherever possible (in no particular order):
